        <p>Collection is a surface phenomenon, whereas boiling is a bulk phenomenon.
           The water evaporates into water vapor, the gas phase of water. 
           There are two types of vaporization: evaporation and boiling. A fully resourced practical lesson on evaporation and condensation based on a video of a solar still by Bear Grylls. Evaporation, mostly from the sea and from vegetation, replenishes the humidity of the air.
            Evaporite, any of a variety of individual minerals found in the sedimentary deposit of soluble salts that results from the evaporation of water. A laboratory flask filled with pure bromine, a liquid that evaporates rapidly. If bubbles are formed we are talking instead about "boiling". Distillation is a separation process that uses substances turn of vaporization and condensation , using them selectively to cleave a generally homogeneous mixture . Lesson suited to all learning types. The reverse of evaporation is condensation. All liquids evaporate except when in a closed container, then no liquids evaporate. When evaporating, the rate of evaporation increases with temperature, and the rate of removing vapour. 
            Vaporization (or vaporisation) of an element or compound is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapour. Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas without forming bubbles inside the liquid volume. </p>
